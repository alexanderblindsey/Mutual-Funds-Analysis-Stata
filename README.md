# Mutual Funds Analysis using Stata

### The Project
This project was submitted as an assignment for an upper-level econometrics class at the University of British Columbia. The assignment received an A+.

In this project, I analyze the causal effect of portfolio manager's education, age, and tenure on the performance of their funds. Data was collected from over 2000 managers who responded to a survey. A manager's education is measured by their SAT score and if they have an MBA or not, a dummy variable with value = 1 if True and =0 if False. The data also includes the managers age and 'tenure', or the number of years in the position. The fund returns, measured by their risk-adjusted excess returns at a specific date, were also collected. 

### The Data
The data used in this project was lost, as initially I did not have the intention of making it public. A printout of the Stata log file containing all the code is included at the end of the report. The raw log file has also been lost.
