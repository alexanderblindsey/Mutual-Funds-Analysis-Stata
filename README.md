# Mutual Funds Analysis using Stata

This project was submitted as an assignment for an upper-level econometrics class at the University of British Columbia. The assignment received an A+.

In this project, I analyze the causal effect of portfolio manager's education, age, and tenure on the performance of their funds. Data was collected from over 2000 managers who responded to a survey. I use Stata to perform a multiple regression of SAT scores, having an MBA, age, and professional tenure on fund returns. The intercepts, OLS coefficients, standard error, and p-value for each independent variable were estimated and summarized. I then check to make sure all Gauss-Markov OLS assumptions are satisfied. 

I include a list of tables and graphs containing summary statistics for all independent variables, the data's kernel density overlaid on a Normal Distribution, and scatter plots of each independent variable on returns. 


The data used in this project was lost, as initially I did not have the intention of posting it on GitHub. A printout of the Stata log file containing all the code is included at the end of the report. The raw log file has also been lost.
